# Omegle Bot
Run your cutomizable Omegle bot directly from your terminal!

## How do I customize the bot?

1. Open "runme.php" with a script editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Machintosh).

2. On line 7, modify the name of the Bot changing **Omegle Bot** with the name you prefer

3. On line 22, modify the message you wanna send each time the bot gets connected to a NEW stranger like you did with the Bot name.

4. On line 27, modify the message you wanna send when the stranger reply to you like you previously did.

5. Save the file and open "php.omegle.php"

6. On line 17, modify the Bot name to the same name you've put in "runme.php" as you already did.

**P.S.** When modifing the lines, you have to keep the **"** before and after the text you have written and DO NOT use the same character, instead you can use the single **'**
